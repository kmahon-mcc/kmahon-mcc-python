Define time_slots as a list with times of day (e.g., "Morning", "Midday", "Afternoon", "Evening").
Use a loop to prompt the user for heart rate (in BPM) at each time slot.
Create a multi-level list heart_rates to store the time slots and their corresponding heart rates.
Calculate the average heart rate and display it.
